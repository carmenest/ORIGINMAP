# Observation O-Δ10: Falls-Only Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Experiment**: O-Δ10 (The Unbiased Sample)

---

## Rationale

Falls (meteorites we saw fall) have **no collection bias**:
- No size bias — we didn't search for them
- No visibility bias — we saw them fall
- No location bias — they fell where they fell

This is our best window into the TRUE flux of meteorites to Earth.

## Dataset

| Category | N | % |
|----------|---|---|
| Falls | 1,107 | 2.4% |
| Finds | 44,609 | 97.6% |

---

## Mass Comparison: Falls vs Finds

| Metric | Falls | Finds |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Median mass | 2,800g | 31g |
| Mean mass | 47,071g | 12,467g |

**Ratio**: Falls are 91.7x larger than Finds
**KS test**: p = 0.00e+00
**Verdict**: VERY_DIFFERENT

## Hypothesis Results

| Hypothesis | Description | Verdict | p-value |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| H-FALL-1 | Mass structure in Falls | NO_STRUCTURE | 0.1450 |
| H-FALL-2 | Class proportions differ | STRONG_DIFFERENCE | 0.00e+00 |
| H-FALL-3 | Seasonality in Falls | no_month_data | N/A |

## Key Findings

1. **Falls are much larger than Finds** — 92x median mass difference confirms collection bias in Finds
2. **No genuine mass structure in Falls** — Even in the unbiased sample, class heterogeneity is random
3. **Class proportions differ between Falls and Finds** — 10 classes significantly enriched/depleted
   - Over-represented in Falls: Stone-uncl, OC, L
   - Under-represented in Falls: LL5, H4, L5

---

## Interpretation

**Mixed results**: Some patterns in Falls, but not conclusive evidence of genuine physical structure.
